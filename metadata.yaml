description: The old-fashioned ghost-story was always terrifying and ghastly; something
  that made people afraid to go to bed, or to look over their shoulders, or to enter
  a room in the dark. It dealt with apparitions in a white sheet, and clanking chains,
  and dreadful faces that peered out from behind the window curtains in a haunted
  chamber. And the more blood-curdling it was, the more keenly people enjoyed it-until
  they were left alone, and then they were apt to wish that they had been reading
  "Robinson Crusoe" or Alison's "History of Europe" instead. Now the present book
  embodies an attempt to write a cheerful ghost-story; a story in which the ghostly
  element is of a friendly and pleasant character, and sheds a sense of happiness
  and sunshine over the entire life of the ghost-seer. Whether the author has succeeded
  in doing so will be for his readers to decide. It is only necessary to add that
  he has not introduced a single supernormal incident that has not occurred and been
  authenticated in the recorded experiences of persons lately or still alive.
